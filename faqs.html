            <div class="question">What is EPD?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                EPD, or EvolvePD is the annual event of Synapse, the Biology Club of The Mother’s International School where the participants play the role of a virtual doctor, identifying the disease with the help of various clues and cues given by the patients (played by Synapse Members).

            <div class="question"> Do I have to do EPD in teams?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Even though it is not compulsory, EPD is best done when in a team. There is so much to explore and do as a virtual doctor, that it will be less fun to do it alone. However, you may register individually, in teams of 2 or maximum of 3. The teams could be from different grades, but it is preferable that students make teams in their own grade.
