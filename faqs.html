            <div class="question">What is EPD?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                EPD, or EvolvePD is the annual event of Synapse, the Biology Club of The Motherâ€™s International School where the participants play the role of a virtual doctor, identifying the disease with the help of various clues and cues given by the patients (played by Synapse Members).

            <div class="question"> Do I have to do EPD in teams?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Even though it is not compulsory, EPD is best done when in a team. There is so much to explore and do as a virtual doctor, that it will be less fun to do it alone. However, you may register individually, in teams of 2 or maximum of 3. The teams could be from different grades, but it is preferable that students make teams in their own grade.

                We start by giving you a conversation of the patient/subject with themselves, with people who have brought them or with the doctor. <br>

                "Mom: Doctor, there's something wrong with my baby boy. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                
                      Adam: Mom, I'm like 12 now, I'm not a baby.   <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                         Mom: Shush. So doc, he has had 5 fractures over the past year. My whittle baby, how is he going to play?   <br>                                                                                                                                                                                         Adam: Jesus, mom, Coach said it's nothing. I'm just a bit out of form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mom: Momma knows best sweetie. So doctor, what do we do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Adam: We tie a bandage and GO HOME!"
                
                Next, the doctor shall ask for tests, look for any physical signs or any form of inspection you want to do on the subject.<br>
                
                The relevant tests for the given disease were: "Blood test for hormone levels, and/or for minerals, MRI/CT of head and neck."<br>
                
                For whatever tests the doctor demands, the patients gives the results (be specific in the test demands though). If the tests are not required, then the results will come out to be normal or the patient will deny the test.<br>
                
                Results to the relevant tests: "Adrenaline level: 70ng/L, Parathormone level: 200ng/L, T4 level: 11mg/dL, T3 level: 150 ng/dL, Testosterone: 900 ng/dL; Calcium level: 15 mg/dl; MRI/CT scan reveals hypervascular, hypoechoic mass located posterior to thyroid gland"<br>
                
                We may also give reports or photos of the scan, if applicable to the disease.  <br>                                                                                                                                                                    
                
                Next, we give hints in form of "specific dialogues" in between, make sure to pay attention to each and every word ;)<br>
                
                "Shoo fly, shoo fly, don't bother me... I feel, I feel like a butterfly..."<br>
                
                "Mom: That other doctor, that silly sod of a doctor, he said my little sugar lump had some sort of deficiency. How dare he say that?! Isn't it just so absurd? I give my baby enough calcium and vitamins, thank you very much."  <br>                                                                                                                             
                
                When the team is approaching close to the answer, we give cues, which are in the conversation, and direct you towards the answer.<br>
                
                "Mother is otherwise just annoying."<br>
                
                Finally, when you are pin-point close or the level deserves a giveaway, we give clues<br>
                
                "Neck flower."<br>
                
                So, by the analysis of all, i.e, Message, Test Results, Cues and Clues, you are supposed to reach your answer. <br>
                Here, the test results hint toward a formation in the thyroid gland and the constant hint of "butterfly" or "neck flower", signify the shape.
                Therefore, you should think something related to butterfly shaped tumours in the thyroid gland.
                These finally give the disease, which is "Parathyroid Carcinoma."
